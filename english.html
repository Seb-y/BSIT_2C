              <span class="fw-bold text-uppercase mb-3">1 | Modal verbs</span>
            </p>
            <p>are special verbs which behave very differently from normal verbs. Here are some important differences:</p>
            <p>
              1. Modal verbs do not take "-s" in the third person.<br />
              Examples:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>He can speak Chinese.</li>
              <li>She should be here by 9:00.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              2. You use "not" to make modal verbs negative, even in simple present and simple past. <br />
              Examples:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>He should not be late.</li>
              <li>They might not come to the party.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              3. Many modal verbs cannot be used in the past tenses or the future tenses. <br />
              Examples:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>He <span class="fw-bold"> will can</span> go with us. <span class="fst-italic"> Not Correct</span></li>
              <li>She <span class="fw-bold"> musted</span> study very hard. <span class="fst-italic"> Not Correct</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="fw-bold">Common Modal Verbs</p>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-sm-6">
                <ul>
                  <li>Can</li>
                  <li>Could</li>
                  <li>May</li>
                  <li>Might</li>
                  <li>Must</li>
                  <li>Ought</li>

                <ul>
                  <li>to</li>
                  <li>Shall</li>
                  <li>Should</li>
                  <li>Will</li>
                  <li>Would</li>

            <p class="fw-bold text-uppercase">3 | Question Tags</p>
            <p>
              You probably want to know what a question tag is, don't you? The <span class="fw-bold"> question tag</span> definition is simple: a
              short phrase spoken or written at the end of a statement that changes the statement into a question, just like the previous sentence
              did. For example, some common question tags are ''don't you?'' and ''is it?''. Question tags may be used when:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>making a statement into a question;</li>
              <li>trying to confirm something; or</li>
              <li>the audience is expected to agree with a statement.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              This lesson will explore the uses of question tags, explain how they are formed, and give examples of positive, negative, and special
              question tags.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-3">
              <span class="fw-bold">What Is Meant by Question Tag?</span><br />
              Question tags are so named because they turn statements into questions, and, like a tag, they cannot be used by themselves. They must
              always be tagged onto the ends of other statements.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              <span class="fw-bold"> How to Form a Question Tag</span> <br />
              A question tag is formed by inverting the subject and verb of a statement. If the subject is a noun, it may be necessary to change the
              noun into a pronoun, such as in the statement ''The dog hasn't eaten dinner yet, has he?'' Question tags can also be formed with dummy
              pronouns like it and there. For example, ''There are many clouds in the sky, aren't there?'' or ''It's not going to rain tomorrow, is
              it?''
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              Question tags are formed with auxiliary verbs, not lexical verbs. <span class="fw-bold"> Auxiliary verbs</span> cannot stand alone and
              include verbs such as do, be, have, may, can, shall, and will, to name a few. If an auxiliary verb is not used in the statement, the
              verb do may be used in the question tag to complete the sentence. For example, ''They usually eat dinner late at night, don't they?''
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              <span class="fw-bold"> Question Tags and Intonation</span> <br />
              The vocal intonation used when speaking with question tags helps to clarify the speaker's intent. When a speaker says a question tag
              with a descending intonation, it is because they expect that the listener will confirm that the statement is correct. When a speaker
              says a question tag with an ascending intonation, however, it is because they are unsure that the statement is correct. It indicates
              that a real question is being asked within the frame of a question tag.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              <span class="fw-bold"> Question Tag Examples </span><br />
              There are various types of question tags that correspond to different kinds of statements. The following sections give an example of
              positive question tags as well as negative question tags.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">Positive Question Tag Examples</p>
            <p><span class="fw-bold">Positive question tags are</span> used when the speaker's statement is negative. For example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>I didn't miss any calls while I was away, did I?</li>
              <li>We weren't supposed to bring gifts to the party, were we?</li>
              <li>She's not at home, is she?</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-3">These question tags are all considered positive because they include the positive form of the auxiliary verb.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">Negative Question Tag Examples</p>
            <p><span class="fw-bold">Negative question tags</span> are used when the speaker's statement is positive. For example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>He wants chocolate ice cream, doesn't he?</li>
              <li>Today is your birthday, isn't it?</li>
              <li>They are twins, aren't they?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These question tags are all considered negative because they include the negative form of the auxiliary verb.</p>

            <p class="fw-bold text-uppercase mb-3">4 | Conditionals</p>
            <p>
              There are several structures in English that we call <span class="fw-bold">conditionals</span> or
              <span class="fw-bold fst-italic">if</span> <span class="fw-bold">conditionals</span> . The word "condition" means "situation or
              circumstance". If a particular condition is true, then a particular result happens:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="fw-bold fst-italic"> if</span> y = 3 <span class="fw-bold fst-italic"> then</span> 2y = 6</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              There are <span class="fw-bold"> three basic English conditionals</span> plus the so-called
              <span class="fw-bold"> zero conditional</span>. There are some more conditionals that we do not use so often.

              real possibility that this condition will happen. For example, you do <span class="fw-bold"> not</span> have a lottery ticket. Is it
              possible to win? No! No lottery ticket, no win! But maybe you will buy a lottery ticket in the future. So you can think about winning in
              the future, like a dream. It's not very real, but it's still possible.

              <span class="fw-bold">What is a preposition?</span> <br />
              Prepositions tell us where or when something is in relation to something else. When monsters are approaching, it’s good to have these
              special words to tell us where those monsters are. Are they <span class="fw-bold">behind</span> us or
              <span class="fw-bold"> in front of</span> us? Will they be arriving <span class="fw-bold"> in</span> three seconds or

              midnight?
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              Prepositions often tell us where one <a class="text-decoration-none" href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/common-noun/">noun</a> is in
              relation to another (e.g.,

              they can also indicate more abstract ideas, such as purpose or contrast (e.g.,

              Unfortunately, there’s no reliable formula for determining which preposition to use with a particular combination of words. The best way
              to learn which prepositions go with which words is to read as much high-quality writing as you can and pay attention to which
              combinations sound right. Here are a few examples of the most common prepositions used in sentences.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              <span class="fst-italic"> I should rewrite the introduction of my essay. </span> <br />
              <span class="fst-italic"> Sam left his jacket in the car. </span> <br />
              <span class="fst-italic"> Did you send that letter to your mother?</span> <br />
              <span class="fst-italic"> We’re cooking for ten guests tonight. </span> <br />
              <span class="fst-italic"> Dan ate lunch with his boss.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              You can also use tools like Google Ngrams to see which prepositions most commonly occur with particular words—but remember, this tool
              can’t explain the difference in meaning between different
              <a class="text-decoration-none" href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/prepositional-phrase/">prepositional phrases</a> like “pay for” (to
              purchase) and “pay off” (to bribe). For that, you may want to refer to a list of prepositions that includes the meanings of common
              combinations.

              >
              has been utterly debunked. It’s not true and it never was true. Writers who always insist that a preposition can’t end a sentence often
              end up with stilted and unnatural sentences:
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              <span class="fst-italic"> There’s no one else to hide behind . (Grammatically correct and natural)</span> <br />

              <span class="fst-italic"> From where did you come? (Grammatically correct, but unnatural)</span>
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              That said, it is sometimes more elegant to move a preposition to an earlier spot in a sentence, especially in very serious and
              <a class="text-decoration-none" href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/formal-vs-informal-writing/"> formal writing</a>. But if you do
              move the preposition, remember to delete it from the end.

              <span class="fw-bold">Unnecessary prepositions</span> <br />
              One of the most common preposition mistakes is adding an unnecessary at to the end of a question.

              , it’s considered an error in writing. You can fix the problem by simply deleting the at.
            </p>
            <p class="fst-italic mb-3">Where is your brother?</p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              On the bright side, if you’re not sure which preposition to use, sometimes you can just get rid of it altogether. In fact, you should
              always get rid of unnecessary prepositional phrases. Too many prepositions can be a sign of flabby writing. Look at how many
              prepositions appear in the sentence below:
            </p>
            <p class="fst-italic mb-3">For many people, the reality of an entry into a new area of employment is cause for a host of anxieties.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              Getting rid of the prepositions forces you to tighten up the sentence. The result is shorter, more direct, and easier to understand:
            </p>
            <p class="fst-italic mb-3">Changing careers makes many people anxious.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">Here’s another example:</p>
            <p class="fst-italic mb-3">Alex hit the baseball up over the fence.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">Get rid of the <span class="fst-italic"> up</span>. You don’t need it:</p>
            <p class="fst-italic">Alex hit the baseball over the fence.</p>

            <p class="mb-3">
              <span class="fw-bold">What is the passive voice? </span><br />
              In general, the <span class="fw-bold"> active voice</span> makes your writing stronger, more direct, and, you guessed it, more active.
              The subject is something, or it does the action of the verb in the sentence. With the <span class="fw-bold"> passive voice</span>, the
              subject is acted upon by some other performer of the verb. (In case you weren’t paying attention, the previous two sentences use the
              type of voice they describe.)
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              But the passive voice is not incorrect. In fact, there are times when it can come in handy. Read on to learn how to form the
              <a class="text-decoration-none" href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/active-vs-passive-voice/"> active and passive voices</a>, when
              using the passive voice is a good idea, and how to avoid confusing it with similar forms.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              <span class="fw-bold"> The difference between active and passive voice</span> <br />
              While tense is all about time references, voice describes whether the grammatical subject of a clause performs or receives the action of
              the <a class="text-decoration-none" href="https://www.grammarly.com/blog/verbs/"> verb</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">Here’s the formula for the active voice:</p>
            <p class="fw-bold mb-3">[subject]+[verb (performed by the subject)]+[optional object]</p>
            <p class="fst-italic mb-3">Chester kicked the ball.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              In a passive voice construction, the grammatical subject of the clause <span class="fst-italic">receives</span> the action of the verb.
              So, the ball from the above sentence, which is <span class="fst-italic">receiving</span> the action, becomes the subject. The formula:
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold mb-3">[subject]+[some form of the verb to be]+[past participle of a transitive verb]+[optional prepositional phrase]</p>
            <p class="fst-italic mb-3">The ball was kicked by Chester.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              That last little bit—“by Chester”—is a prepositional phrase that tells you who the performer of the action is. But even though Chester
              is the one doing the kicking, he’s no longer the grammatical subject. A passive voice construction can even drop him from the sentence
              entirely:
            </p>
            <p class="fst-italic">The ball was kicked.</p>
            <p class="fst-italic">How’s that for anticlimactic?</p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              <span class="fw-bold">When (and when not) to use the passive voice</span> <br />
              If you’re writing anything with a definitive subject who’s performing an action, you’ll be better off using the active voice. And if you
              search your document for instances of <span class="fst-italic"> was, is</span>, or <span class="fst-italic">were</span> and your page
              lights up with instances of passive voice, it may be a good idea to switch to active voice.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              That said, there are times when the passive voice does a better job of presenting an idea, especially in certain formal, professional,
              and legal discussions. Here are three common uses of the passive voice:
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold mb-3">1. Reports of crimes or incidents with unknown perpetrators</p>
            <p>Example: My car was stolen yesterday .</p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              If you knew who stole the car, it probably wouldn’t be as big a problem. The passive voice emphasizes the stolen item and the action of
              theft.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold mb-3">2. Scientific contexts</p>
            <p class="mb-3">Example: The rat was placed into a T-shaped maze.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              Who places the rat into the maze? Scientists, duh. But that’s less important than the experiment they’re conducting. Therefore, passive
              voice.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold mb-3">3. When you want to emphasize an action itself and the doer of the action is irrelevant or distracting:</p>
            <p class="mb-3">Example: The president was sworn in on a cold January morning.</p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              How many people can remember off the top of their heads who swears in presidents? Clearly the occasion of swearing in the commander in
              chief is the thing to emphasize here.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              In each of the above contexts, the action itself—or the person or thing receiving the action—is the part that matters. That means the
              performer of the action can appear in a prepositional phrase or be absent from the sentence altogether.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="fw-bold">Comparative adjectives</span><br />
              We use comparative adjectives to show change or make comparisons:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>This car is certainly <span class="fw-bold"> better</span>, but it's much <span class="fw-bold"> more expensive</span>.</li>
              <li>I'm feeling <span class="fw-bold"> happier</span> now.</li>
              <li>We need a <span class="fw-bold"> bigger</span> garden.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We use than when we want to <span class="fw-bold"> compare one thing with another</span>:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>She is two years older <span class="fw-bold"> than</span> me.</li>
              <li>New York is much bigger <span class="fw-bold"> than</span> Boston.</li>
              <li>He is a better player <span class="fw-bold"> than</span> Ronaldo.</li>
              <li>France is a bigger country <span class="fw-bold"> than</span> Britain.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When we want to <span class="fw-bold"> describe how something or someone changes</span> we can use two comparatives with and:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The balloon got bigger <span class="fw-bold"> and bigger</span>.</li>
              <li>Everything is getting <span class="fw-bold"> more and more expensive.</span></li>
              <li>Grandfather is looking <span class="fw-bold"> older and older</span> .</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-3">We often use the with comparative adjectives to <span class="fw-bold"> show that one thing depends on another</span>:</p>
            <p class="mb-3">
              <span class="fw-bold">The faster</span> you drive, <span class="fw-bold">the more dangerous</span> it is. (When you drive faster, it is
              more dangerous.)
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="fw-bold"> The higher</span> they climbed, <span class="fw-bold"> the colder</span> it got. (When they climbed higher, it
              got colder.)
