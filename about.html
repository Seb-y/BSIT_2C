		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hi there! My name is Paul Oliquino, and I am a student currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology at Bicol University. I am also proud to be a Sr. Associate under Innodata Inc., where I have honed my skills in Data Analytics, Research, Writing, and Photography.</p>
		<p>My passion for technology and data led me to pursue a career in the field of IT. I am constantly seeking new ways to improve my skills and knowledge in this ever-evolving industry.</p>
		<p>In addition to my technical abilities, I also have a passion for creative pursuits such as writing and photography. I have found that these skills have allowed me to approach problems in a unique and innovative way.
